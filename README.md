A bookshop system is designed to be a mock-up application of an online bookstore selling books online. The project ''Bookshop System'' aims at providing a platform that allows a customer to search and purchase a book based on the bookâ€™s title, author and subject. Among its functionalities include customer accounts, inventory management, order management, product configurator and shopping cart. It provides the user with a catalog of different books available for purchase in the store. Through the application a customer can search for a book by its title, category or author, add to the shopping cart and finally purchase using top-up transactions, The system is implemented using a backend database and a desktop application as the front end to the client. Making use of the following tools: Python programming language, Tkinter, and SQLite3 database management system, a user friendly, flexible and reliable system for book sales was developed.
